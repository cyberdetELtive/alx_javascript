DOM Manipulation Project
This project consists of four tasks aimed at demonstrating various aspects of DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation using JavaScript. Each task focuses on different aspects of working with HTML elements, selectors, content modification, attributes, styles, and the creation and removal of elements.

Task 0: Play with the DOM
Description
In this task, a JavaScript program is created to access and modify an HTML element using the DOM.

Functionality
HTML code provides a starting point with a <p> element and an id.
JavaScript code selects the element using its id and stores it in a variable.
The DOM API is used to modify the content of the <p> element.
document.getElementById is utilized for element selection.
The program successfully modifies the element content when the HTML file is opened in a browser.
Task 1: Selecting HTML Elements Using Selectors
Description
In this task, a JavaScript program demonstrates the use of selectors to select specific HTML elements and modify their format.

Functionality
HTML code contains paragraphs with different classes.
JavaScript code uses the DOM API to select the <p> element with a specific class and makes its content bold.
document.querySelectorAll is used for element selection.
The program successfully modifies the element's format when the HTML file is opened in a browser.
Task 2: Modifying Element Content, Attributes, and Styles
Description
In this task, a JavaScript program showcases the modification of content, attributes, and styles of an HTML element using the DOM.

Functionality
HTML code provides an <img> element with an id.
JavaScript code selects the <img> element using its id and stores it in a variable.
The DOM API is used to modify the <img> element's src, alt, and border style.
document.getElementById is utilized for element selection.
The program successfully modifies the element when the HTML file is opened in a browser.
Task 3: Creating, Appending, and Removing Elements
Description
In this task, a JavaScript program demonstrates the creation, appending, and removal of elements using the DOM.

Functionality
HTML code includes a container <div>.
JavaScript code selects the container element using its id and stores it in a variable.
The DOM API is used to create a new <p> element, append it to the container, and toggle its visibility with a button.
The program successfully creates, appends, and toggles elements when the HTML file is opened in a browser.
